# Tauri + React

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri and React in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Satu Toko Scraper

- Chromedriver will be stored in %LOCALAPPDATA%/satu-toko/chromedriver on Windows.
- To run locally: install dependencies (`npm install`), then `npm run dev` and `npm run tauri dev` in separate terminals.
- This is a proof-of-concept; Tokopedia selectors, rate limits, and anti-bot measures may require additional handling.
